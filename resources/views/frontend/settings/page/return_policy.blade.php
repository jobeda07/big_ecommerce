                          Please email us at   info@beautyproductsbd.com if there is anything about our service that you find to be unsatisfactory. 
                          Weâ€™ll make an effort to make things right. You will never receive a refund from us. If a solution cannot be identified, 
                          we provide a replacement file at a maximum cost of your pack.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Except as may be permitted by law, no refunds will be given if we terminate your services because you violated our terms of use or 
                          another provision of our Terms and Conditions. You still have all of your legal rights.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          There are no refunds for files that were purchased using a coupon code or a promotion. Money Back Guarantee only applies when we fail to 
                          deliver service or when we make a mistake with the service.
                          <br>
                          Any money provided to Cods Shop that is more than what is owing can only be credited back; it cannot be returned.
